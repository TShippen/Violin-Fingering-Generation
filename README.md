# Violin Fingering Generation

We build an intelligent system which generates fingerings for violin music in an interactive way. Instead of fully-automatic generation of violin fingerings, the system provides multiple generation paths and yield adaptable fingering arrangements for users. A new violin dataset with fingering annotations is also proposed. For more details, please refer to ["Positioning Left-hand Movement in Violin Performance: A System and User Study of Fingering Pattern Generation" (IUI 2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3397481.3450661?sid=SCITRUS).
